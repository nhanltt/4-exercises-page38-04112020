1. Implement the simple methods get_num and get_den that will return the numerator
and denominator of a fraction.
2. In many ways it would be better if all fractions were maintained in lowest terms right
from the start. Modify the constructor for the Fraction class so that GCD is used to
reduce fractions immediately. Notice that this means the __add__ function no longer
needs to reduce. Make the necessary modifications.
3. Implement the remaining simple arithmetic operators (__sub__, __mul__, and
__truediv__).
4. Implement the remaining relational operators (__gt__, __ge__, __lt__, __le__, and
__ne__)
